# Code maze generating algorithm

1 - Define matrix where SDL_Rects to be drawn to resemble a maze:
  ** Matrix properties:
    1 - Auto scale SDL_Rect size depending on the current display.
    2 - Define screen coordinate borders
    3 - TODO...

2 - Store SDL_Rects screen coordinates on the matrix in an array.

3 - Select starting SDL_Rect and destination SDL_Rect.

4 - Given a to-be decided algorithm fill SDL_Rects to create multiple paths that reach the destination SDL_Rect

5 - Implement A* to find the closest path.

6 - Animate motion by coloring the curent SDL_Rect in a distinct color while having filled the previously reached paths in a different color from the rest of the SDL_Rects

7 - TODO...
